            <li>1 Hotdog long bun</li>
            <li>1 Hotdog</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook hot dogs using preferred method:

                Grilling Method: Heat hot dogs over medium (or indirect) heat on grill, turning occasionally. Cook until fully heated internally and there is a nice, even char on all sides, being careful not to burn them.
                
                Boiling Method: Fill a saucepan with about 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn heat to low and add hot dogs. Simmer for about 5 minutes, or until hotdogs are fully heated.
                
                Combination Method: First, boil hot dogs using the boiling method above to ensure they are warmed through. Then, grill hot dogs on a grill over high heat until they have a nice char, or broil in the oven for a few minutes
                
                Campfire Method: Place hot dogs on skewers. Cook over the fire, rotating occasionally, about two to four minutes or until the outside is bubbling and browned.
                
                Alternate Methods: You can also fry the hot dogs in a pan with olive oil, or bake them in the oven until fully heated.</li>
                <li>Once hot dogs are fully heated, remove from heat and set aside, drying them off if necessary.</li>
                <li>Place each hot dog in a bun and top with desired toppings and condiments, such as cheese, mustard, ketchup, relish, onions, chili, etc.</li>
        </ol>
